### Machine Setup

This repository contain a bunch of scripts and other things that I normally use to setup a new machine (only used on Macs so far).

### What do I need?

* rsync
* Node.js > 8.7.0

### Getting started

To start, just add `./profile.sh` to your `~/.bash_profile` as the following:

```bash
source /path/to/profile.sh
```

Done! You're good to go!
